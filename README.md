Genealogical tree
================
My final project of my degree: an application that lets you create a genealogical tree converting GEDCOM files into a Neo4j structure. The app is built using AngularJS, Node.js and Express, and the first steps are based in conceptual-chains by James H. Edwards.

To test it:

1) Clone the project

2) cd genealogical-tree

3) npm install

4) Start the Neo4j server
