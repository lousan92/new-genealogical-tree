1 CONC [LA times obit]
1 CONT Stage name was "Buetel" because Howard Hughes was afraid that Beutel 
1 CONC would be pronounced "Beetle." 
1 CONT He had worked in little theater in Dallas before being chosen to appear 
1 CONC opposite Jane Russell in the Outlaw in what news accounts of the day 
1 CONC described as a nationwide talent search. Although receiving a "G" rating 
1 CONC when reisssued in the 1970's, the film became a national scandal when it 
1 CONC was filmed in 1940. The flap held up release until the mid-1940's.
1 CONT He later appeared in a few more movies (Best of the Badmen (1950), The 
1 CONC Half-Breed (1951), Jesse James' Women, Judge Roy Bean(1955)), but never 
1 CONC captured the fame that had accompanied "The Outlaw."

1 CONC died when she was 8 years old. Her father subsequently had several women 
1 CONC in his life, not all of whom he married. Louisa, Annie's first 
1 CONC stepmother, had a policy of locking Annie out of the house whenever she 
1 CONC didn't wish to be caring for her. Rufus discovered this one day, and 
1 CONC Louisa was soon out of the house herself.
1 CONT Annie said later that she really didn't feel she had a family until she 
1 CONC married John Streeter and came to live with him in Vermont. John's 
1 CONC parents welcomed her enthusiastically and so she finally felt at home.

1 CONC This person seemed to be know as "Hial." The first initial is used 
1 CONC because his first name can be found as Nahum, Naham, and Nahan.
1 CONT
1 CONT After the passing of his father, there are two stories concerning Hail. 
1 CONC One is that he went to live with his Uncle Reuben. The other is that he 
1 CONC went to N. Bennington and lived there with his mother for 15 years. Both 
1 CONC may be true since he may have lived with his Uncle until his mother 
1 CONC remarried (Thomas Russell) and moved to Bennington.
1 CONT
1 CONT At age 22, Hial moved to Illinois. He was followed by other members of 
1 CONC his family who made permanent residences in the West. He showed Palatine, 
1 CONC Illinois as his place of residence on his marriage certificate. In April, 
1 CONC 1858, Hial and Catherine went to Illinois and made their home there for 
1 CONC two years.
1 CONT
1 CONT They came back East and lived in Winhall with Hosea and Sarah Vaile. 1860 
1 CONC Census list Hose Vail - age 60 - Male - Farmer - Birthplace Vt - Value of 
1 CONC personal property $150; Sarah Vail - age 60 - Female - Wife - Birthplace 
1 CONC Vt; Hial Robinson - age 26 - Male - Farmer - Birthplace Vt - Value of 
1 CONC personal property $30; Catharan L. Robinson - age 21 - Female - Wife - 
1 CONC Birthplace Vt; Heiler L. Robinson - age 1 - Female - Birthplace Illinois.
1 CONT
1 CONT Hial and his family lived in a log house in Winhall where the children 
1 CONC listened to the holler of the bears. It was located on what is now part 
1 CONC of the Stratton Golf Course and was called Orcutt Meadows. Their second 
1 CONC through fifth children were born here. Hila and Fred addended school in 
1 CONC District 1 in Stratton. This was the nearest school to where they lived.
1 CONT
1 CONT 1870 Census list Robinson, Hial N. - age 36 - Farmer - Value of real 
1 CONC estate $300 - Value of personal property $200; Robinson, Cath - age 32; 
1 CONC Robinson, Hila L. - age 11; Robinson, Fred E. - age 9; Robinson, Avis E. 
1 CONC - age 7; Robinson, Almon R. - age 5; Robinson, Clara A. - age 2.
1 CONT
1 CONT It has been told that the reason they left Winhall was that the brook 
1 CONC near their place flooded and they had to make a run for it across the 
1 CONC brook with their possessions and Fred carrying the little girls on his 
1 CONC back with the water up to his knees. They never moved back.
1 CONT
1 CONT They moved to West Wardsboro, VT around 1871 where Hial was for two years 
1 CONC proprieter of the hotel. They lived on a small farm in the northeast part 
1 CONC of Wardsboro - called the Little Place. While proprietor of the hotel, 
1 CONC Hial was the victem of a clever trick played by a travelling salesman. In 
1 CONC those days, liquor was sold over the bar in most hotels and taverns and 
1 CONC added much to the volume of business and prosperity of tavern keepers. 
1 CONC This man came into the barroom to settle his bill, whick included 
1 CONC lodging, meals, horsekeeping, etc., meanwhile purchaseing cigars and a 
1 CONC bottle of whiskey. He handed Hial a $100 bill in payment. This was much 
1 CONC more that Hial ever had on hand, and he was unable to make change, he had 
1 CONC to let the salesman go without paying. Thomas Johnson happened to be in 
1 CONC the barroom at the time and noted Hial's plight. He was there again latet 
1 CONC on when he observed the same salesman stop there again. Johnson stepped 
1 CONC across the road to his brother-in-law, Osmer Fitts' store and borrowed 
1 CONC $100 from him. He returned as the salesman was finishing making purchases 
1 CONC of cigars, liquor, etc. and again offered the $100 bill in payment. When 
1 CONC Hial started to explain that he could not make change for so large a 
1 CONC bill, Johnson spoke up, "Here, Hial, I'll change the bill for you." and 
1 CONC handed over $100 in smaller bills. He was about to pocket the $100 bill 
1 CONC when the salesman suddenly discovered some money in another pocket and 
1 CONC paid what he owed: keeping the $100 bill to play the same trick on some 
1 CONC other tavern keeper, no doubt.
1 CONT
1 CONT Hial and Catherine's sixth through ninthchildren were born in West 
1 CONC Wardsboro.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1873 they bought a farm in West Wardboro where they lived for 34 
1 CONC years. In a Windham County Gazetteer printed in 1884, Nahum H. Robinson 
1 CONC is listed living on Road 1, a farmer, with 300 acres of land. Here they 
1 CONC raised their children to adulthood, worked hard, helped their neighbors. 
1 CONC The story is told of Hial walking down to the village after dark and the 
1 CONC lantern he was carrying kept flickering on and off until finally when he 
1 CONC got near Newell's barn he gave it a heave over against the barn. As he 
1 CONC heard it crash into the wall he said, "Hev'ns Snath, I could have saved 
1 CONC that globe!"  It is told that he never swore but had a favorite saying he 
1 CONC used, "Heavens and Earth," which came out sounding like "Hev'ns Snath."

1 CONC lived in the village. When he bought the farm on the hill that his father 
1 CONC had owned for may years, he moved the blacksmith shop up there.
1 CONT
1 CONT The following article appeared in THE VERMONT PHOENIX, Brattleboro, 
1 CONC Friday Feb 9, 1917:
1 CONT "VERMONT HUNTER CAPTURES 16 BEARS"
1 CONT Albert C. Robinson of Wardsboro has taken six during the present season - 
1 CONC sixteen bears to his credit:
1 CONT Doughty Hunter and Trapper from West Wardsboro Has Shot Six the Past 
1 CONC Season - Also Has Taken Many Deer, Two Bobcats and Other Game - Musical 
1 CONC Family
1 CONT (Picture of a bear Albert shot outside his camp entitled "One of Mr. 
1 CONC Robinson's Trophies of the Present Season")
1 CONT Also
1 CONT (A closeup picture of Albert C. Robinson)
1 CONT The champion bear hunter for southern Vermont, if not the entire stat, 
1 CONC for the season just closed, is Albert C. Robinson of West Wardsboro. He 
1 CONC has shot six bears in his traps since October, making 16 in all that have 
1 CONC fallen victims to his prowess as a hunter and trapper. "Mate" JOnes of 
1 CONC Pikes Falls and "Bill" Howard of Bondville, who live not many miles from 
1 CONC Mr. Robinson, have taken as many in a single season, but that was some 
1 CONC time ago.
1 CONT    On his visit to Brattleboro a few days ago, which was his first visit 
1 CONC here in twoyears, Mr. Robinson talked entertainingly to a respresentative 
1 CONC of The Reformer, relative to the prevalence of bears in the section in 
1 CONC which he lives and about himself and those dependent upon him. Besides 
1 CONC being a hunter and trapper Mr. Robinson carries on a farm of 125 acres 
1 CONC and conducts a blacksmith shop.
1 CONT    "It is quite necessary that I be doing something most of the time, as 
1 CONC I have considerable of a family to support -- a wife and eight children." 
1 CONC asserted Mr. Robinson with a show of pride.
1 CONT    Mr. Robinson is rather under the average as to stature, and a stranger 
1 CONC would not take him to be a champion hunter of game animals but besides 
1 CONC his 16 bears he has killed a deer every year but four since the open 
1 CONC season was established 19 years ago, has shot two bobcats and a variety 
1 CONC of small game. He has ample courage and endurance, and while he neverhas 
1 CONC had any hair-raising experiences, he never has sought to dodge them.  "I 
1 CONC have no more fear for a bear than I have of a hedgehog," he says.
1 CONT    When asked how many bears he supposed there were in Windham County, 
1 CONC Mr. Robinson replied: "That would be hard to say.  Some of us were 
1 CONC talking it over the other day and I said I bet there were not more than a 
1 CONC thousand in Vermont. The territory where I go is as wild as there is 
1 CONC anywhere in the state, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were more 
1 CONC than 200 up there."
1 CONT    There have been many bears near Manchester and Mr. Robinson thinks the 
1 CONC big forest fire in that section last summer drove a good number into the 
1 CONC northwestern part of Windham County.  Anyway they are more numerous in 
1 CONC this county, he says, than he has ever known them to be before.
1 CONT    Mr. Robinson has a shack on Akley mountain, between West Wardsboro and 
1 CONC West Dover, about four miles from his home and a mile and a half from the 
1 CONC Daniel Webster monument on Stratton Mountain. He has frequented the place 
1 CONC the past 10 years.
1 CONT    "I set my traps the latter part of September," Mr. Robinson went on, 
1 CONC "and visit them twice a week until the season ends, which is after deep 
1 CONC snow and cold weather come. The bears hibernate then, and I spring the 
1 CONC traps and leave them."
1 CONT    "For bait I use most anything. They like slat salmon, but more depends 
1 CONC on common sense in setting the traps than on the bait. They have certain 
1 CONC places where they cross the mountains, and if you can find those places 
1 CONC you are likely to have good luck. I have trapped many years, but I never 
1 CONC had much luck until the past seven years. The bear business has helped me 
1 CONC out better than $100 the past fall."
1 CONT    "There is a bounty of $10 on each bear and the pelts are worth $15 or 
1 CONC more. There isn't much demand for bear skins in the fur market, though, 
1 CONC but you can usually find somebody who wants a skin with the head mounted 
1 CONC to use as a rug. The meat I can dispose of at home."
1 CONT    "In the summer time the bears eat berries, nuts, and roots, and 
1 CONC occasionally they make a raid on some sheep pasture. Only last fall they 
1 CONC killed several sheep in an East Dover pasture."
1 CONT    The bears which Mr. Robinson has shot have ranged in weight from 175 
1 CONC to 270 pounds, but specimens weighing more than 400 pounds have been shot 
1 CONC a short distance from West Wardsboro in Stratton.  Not all of his 
1 CONC trophies have been taken in traps.
1 CONT    He carries a rifle on his trips, but a short time ago he happened to 
1 CONC be in the neighborhood of one of his traps a day earlier than usual and 
1 CONC on visiting them found that one was holding a prize. He borrowed a 
1 CONC shotgun and went up within 20 feet of Bruin before firing.  "Most bears 
1 CONC in traps act like whipped dogs," declared Mr. Robinson, "but this one 
1 CONC hadn't been caught long enough to take the sand out of him and was pretty 
1 CONC snappy.  He rose up on his haunches and tried to put up a fight, but the 
1 CONC drag held so he couldn't do any harm."
1 CONT    Being a blacksmith, Mr. Robinson makes his own trpas, and when setting 
1 CONC them he attaches them to drags, which are heavy sticks or pieces of log.  
1 CONC When the bear jumps after the trap is sprung the drag yields a little. 
1 CONC Otherwise the bear might tear himself free before the jaws of the trap 
1 CONC got a firm hand.
1 CONT    "We've got a little band in West Wardsboro that four of my boys and I 
1 CONC plany in," Mr. Robinson volunteered.  "I play the bass drum, Dorian and 
1 CONC Addis play cornets, Travis plays the B flat bass, and Gregory plays 
1 CONC trombone.  We've had quite alot of jobs. Addis, who is 9, can make the 
1 CONC cornet talk."
1 CONT    Mr. Robinson was born in West Wardsboro Oct. 14, 1876, a son of Naham 
1 CONC and Catherine (Vaile) Robinson. He always lived in that part of the town. 
1 CONC For 17 years he has done blacksmithing, most of the time in the village, 
1 CONC but his shop is now on his farm and most of the work he does in that line 
1 CONC now is to accommodate the neighbors.
1 CONT    While working in the Waterbury, VT, asylum Mr. Robinson met Miss 
1 CONC Margaret Curran of Poughkeepsie, NY, and they were married Dec. 31, 
1 CONC 1900.  They have eight children: Dorian, 15; Travis, 13; Gregory, 12; 
1 CONC Paul, 11; Addis, 9; John, 5; Catherine, 3; and Henry, 1.
1 CONT    He has three brothers, Fred, Almon and Elden, all of West Wardsboro, 
1 CONC and four sisters: Hila, wife of Frank E. Ray of Wilmington, Avis of 
1 CONC Brattleboro, widow of Henry Waite, Clara, wife of William R. Nash of 
1 CONC Chicopee Falls, Mass., and Nora, wife of Lute Kendall of West Wardsboro.

1 CONC NOTES: Chester was left without a father at age 2 (suicide). At about age 
1 CONC 19 he sought help from his relatives in New England, thinking of a career 
1 CONC in electrical engineering. Hial Robinson and Richard Roth were attempting 
1 CONC to get him a place at a training institution in Lynn, MA when Chester 
1 CONC suddenly changed his mind and returned to Colorado. Apparently his 
1 CONC spirits became severely depressed and he got off the train "halfway to 
1 CONC his destination." The proprietress of the boarding house where he checked 
1 CONC in noticed his state and contacted Dora Streeter Daniels. She arranged 
1 CONC for him to be escorted the rest of the way home.
1 CONT Chester never really recovered, and ended his own life with a gun at age 
1 CONC 24.

1 CONC [Corrie Austin's book]
1 CONT He is thought to have come from Hinton Blewitt, County Somerset, England, 
1 CONC and to have cast in his lot with that company of emigrants who came from 
1 CONC Plymoth, England, with their church organizations, reaching Nantasket, MA 
1 CONC May 30 or June 9, 1630. It is supposed that William Hayden married after 
1 CONC he came to America, since the first records of births of his children are 
1 CONC some ten years after his arrival in this country. He is thought to have 
1 CONC had brothers, John and James, of whom John settled in Braintree and James 
1 CONC was of Charlston, MA in 1635.
1 CONT William Hayden was a freeman of Dorchester, MA in 1634. In 1637 he was in 
1 CONC the Pequot War under Captain Mason, whose life he saved. Captain Mason 
1 CONC tells of William Hayden coming to his rescue when he was "beset by many 
1 CONC Indians waiting all opportunities to lay hands on me, but William Hayden, 
1 CONC espying a breach in the wigwam, entered, and in his entrance fell over a 
1 CONC dead Indian, but speedily recovering himself - the Indians, some fled - 
1 CONC others crept under their beds." For his service in the Perqout War, a lot 
1 CONC in the Soldiers' Field at Hartford was granted William Hayden about 1639.
1 CONT About 1640, William Hayden appeared in Windsor, for there his first child 
1 CONC was born. He sold his Harford land and dwelling 2/9/1642. In 1644 he 
1 CONC bought property at Windsor. In 1658 William Hayden was ;isted among the 
1 CONC troopers of the colony. There is evidence that besides his farming, some 
1 CONC quarrying was done at his place.
1 CONT He removed to Killingworth (now Clinton), CT about the time of his second 
1 CONC marraige, and in 1667 he was deputy from that town. He deeded certain 
1 CONC lands to his son Daniel 5/17/1669.

1 CONC From The Vermont Phoenix, Brattleboro Edition, 11/12/1915:
1 CONT West Wardsboro - Miss Calphunia Waite Was for Six Years Oldest Women in 
1 CONC Town - Age was 92.
1 CONT Miss Calphurnia Submit Waite, whose death occurred at her home in this 
1 CONC place Oct. 31, at the age of 92 years, seven months, six days, had been 
1 CONC for six years the oldest woman in town. She was born Marh 25, 1823, in 
1 CONC the northern part of Stratton, and was the oldest of six children of 
1 CONC Luther and Asenath Scott Waite. She attended public school in her native 
1 CONC town and Leland Gray Seminary in Townshend. At the are of 15 years she 
1 CONC moved with the family to the Seventh day neighborhood in Jamaica. In 
1 CONC June, 1855, her father died, and in the following year she with the 
1 CONC remaining members of the family moved to Wardsboro to the place known as 
1 CONC the Clark Harris farm. Thence, in 1859 they moved to a farmin the Carter 
1 CONC district near the Jamaica line, where they lived about 30 years. It was 
1 CONC at this place that the mother died at the age of 92 years, and here they 
1 CONC were living when the buildings and nearly all their property were 
1 CONC destroyed by a fire. Miss Waite, with her sister, Lucina, and here 
1 CONC brother, William, lived for a short time following the fire in the Moses 
1 CONC Smith house, after which she bought the Smead place, where she spent the 
1 CONC reat of her life, and where the sister died about 5 years ago. In the 
1 CONC days of here youth she taught school in several districs in Jamaica and 
1 CONC Winhall. She also worked in the woolen mills in Hinsdale, N. H. and 
1 CONC Putney. The ill health of her mother and of the only sister at home, 
1 CONC compelled her to retire from public activity and to minister to the needs 
1 CONC of her family to which she was most faithful. This she did alone until 
1 CONC about five years ago, when Mr. and Mrs. Sherman Waite came to care for 
1 CONC her and her brother in their declining years.
1 CONT Miss Waite was for many years a member of the Methodist Church in 
1 CONC Wardsboro. She was a Bible student and a very industrious woman, even to 
1 CONC the time of breaking fer hip a few weeks ago insisting on caring for her 
1 CONC brother's room. She was fond of the usual occupation of country women of 
1 CONC advanced age - the braiding of hats and the piecing of quilts. She was of 
1 CONC gentle disposition, kindly towards all.
1 CONT In the past few years her memory failed gradually, her physical strength 
1 CONC predominating. She leaves one sister, Mrs. Oscar Blodgett of Putney, and 
1 CONC one brother, William, of this place.

1 CONC From The Vermont Phoenix, 1/13/1911:
1 CONT Brattleboro, Vermont - "Golden Wedding in Wardsboro"
1 CONT Mr. and Mrs. Dexter Waite Observed Anniversary Yesterday... Received 
1 CONC Purse of $110, including $50 in Gold from Sons in the West... Wedding 
1 CONC Cake Cut by the Bride.
1 CONT Happiness and good cheer abounded in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Dexter 
1 CONC Waite of Wardsboro yesterday afternoon and last evening, when Mr. and 
1 CONC Mrs. Waite observed their golden wedding anniversary. Sixty friends and 
1 CONC neighbors called between 3 and 8 o'clock to extend congratulations and 
1 CONC best wishes and they were received in the good spirit that is 
1 CONC characteristic of Mr. and Mrs. Waite.
1 CONT The host and hostess were recipients of many handsome gifts, including 
1 CONC $110 in money, of which $90 was in gold. Their two sons in the West sent 
1 CONC $50 in gold. 
1 CONT The dining room table presented a handsome appearance in decorations of 
1 CONC yellow and white with a centrepiece of white carnations. A buffet 
1 CONC luncheon of cake, coffee and sandwiches was served and a wedding cake was 
1 CONC cut by the bride.
1 CONT The Wardsboro pastor, Rev. W.S. Boardman, read a pleasing poem, written 
1 CONC for the occasion by Rev. A. B. Jopson of Union Village, a friend of the 
1 CONC family, and several phonographic selections were rendered.
1 CONT Dexter was born in Stratton Feb. 7, 1839, and was a son of Tyler and 
1 CONC Lucia Waite. When he was seven years old his parents moved to Wardsboro. 
1 CONC Orthalia M. Barrett, his wife, was born in South Londonderry, Aug. 30, 
1 CONC 1839, and was a daughter of Hubbard and Mary P. Barrett. They were 
1 CONC married Jan. 12, 1861. The next year Mr. Waite enlisted in Company D, 
1 CONC 16th Vermont Volunteers, at South Londonderry. His grandfather Waite 
1 CONC served in the Revolutionary War.
1 CONT In 1866 they moved from South Londonderry to Wardsboro, where they were 
1 CONC engaged in farming five years. Then they moved to the village and Mr. 
1 CONC Waite conducted a hotel and livery business 15 years and was actively 
1 CONC engaged in buying and selling horses. He was postmaster four years under 
1 CONC President Benjamin Harrison's administration. In 1895 they moved to 
1 CONC Brattleboro, where Mr. Waite and his son, Frank D., were in the painting 
1 CONC business 11 years. Mr. and Mrs. Waite then moved back to Wardsboro.
1 CONT    Mr. and Mrs. Waite are deeply attached to their home and a cordial 
1 CONC welcome is assured whoever goes there. They are congenial and happy and 
1 CONC always ready to do an act of kindness or charity. Mr. Waite is a strong 
1 CONC Republican. He has been a delegate to 10 Republican state conventions and 
1 CONC always has taken an active part in politics. He has voted for every 
1 CONC president from Lincoln to Taft.
1 CONT    Mr. Waite had two brothers, one a judge in Illinois, who died several 
1 CONC years ago, and Henry Waite, who now lives in West Wardsboro; also four 
1 CONC sisters: Laura, Lucia, Christina and Ruth, all of whom are dead.  Mrs. 
1 CONC Waite had two brothers, Frank W. and Calvin F., who have been dead 
1 CONC several years, and one sister, Mrs. Mary Eddy of Wardsboro.  Mr. and Mrs. 
1 CONC Waite have two sons, George E. of Seattle, Wash., manager of the 
1 CONC wholesale house of Cluett & Peabody, makers of shirts and collars, and 
1 CONC Frank D. of Spokane, Wash., who is engaged in the clothing and men's 
1 CONC furnishings business."

1 CONC their 60th wedding anniversary.
1 CONT      About 100 friends and relatives called at the Robinson home during

1 CONT      Mr. and Mrs. Robinson recalled that they traveled by sleigh to and
