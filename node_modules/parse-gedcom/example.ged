1 OCCU VETINARIAN(FARM ANIMALS)
1 NOTE Antoine Lariviere was born in the Red River Settlement Area now Winnipeg in the Parish of St Eustach, or St. Francis-Xavier. Manitoba.  He was the oldest son and became the working partner with his father Antoine Sr as 
2 CONC veternarians for most of the farms in the Walhalla, Olga, Langdon area.
2 CONT He Married Agnes Villeneuve, the daughter of his father's friend, Hyacinthe Villeneuve.
2 CONT Antoine and his wife married in St Boniface, Winnipeg, Canada. They lived in Olga, ND for several years before building a house in Beaulieu area, just below and north east Olga along a bluff overlooking a green valley of trees and 
2 CONC the branch of the Pembina River. These hills are sometimes referred to the Lariviere Hills by the old timers, now most of the locals call these hills the Darling hills. Around 1926, their house was accidently burnt down when the 
2 CONC youngest son came home from school in early spring and made a roaring fire in the stove. The Stove overheated and eventually burnt the house down before anyone could save it. Antoine and Agnes lost all of their possessions in the 
2 CONC fire including all of Antoines fine collection of guns, trapping gear, medical tools, etc.
2 CONT They later built a log house and then added another section of regular construction for their new home located down in the valley close to the river right where there was a bridge over the little Pembina. Further up the road west, 
2 CONC lived the Schills, then the Clarks and then the country school. The home was situated along the meandering river amoung the oak and elm trees, and willows It was a place of many family gatherings and parties. They held many "Bees" 
2 CONC to cut wood, build sheds, or help neighbors in need. These happenings usually drew neighbors and cousins from miles (a long way was 10 miles) around and featured picnics and dances with home-made brew.
2 CONT The only sons around during these times (1930 - 1940) were Louie, Lawrence and Noel. Louie joined the CCCs and came home only once every few months; Lawrence and Noel were newly married and lived nearby.
2 CONT They lived here until about 1948 when living alone without transportation in the winter became too much of a hardship at their age. They moved to Walhalla and lived there until Antoine died on a cold evening on November 1957. He 
2 CONC walked outside after eating his evening meal for a breath of fresh air and soon came back with chest pains, laid down on the couch, and asked his wife to get the priest. Agnes immediately sent the neighbor kid to get the priest 
2 CONC and the doctor. The priest, Father Longpre (sp) arrived and gave him the last sacrements while he was still alive. He soon drifted off and when the doctor arrived, he sooned pronounced him dead. (This was all told directly to me 
2 CONC by my grandmother, Agnes Villeneuve Lariviere two days after the death of my grandfather, Antoine Lariviere). His funeral was attended by many of his old friends, neighbors, and his family. Two of his Brothers, Frank and Edward 
2 CONC came from the HIbbing Minnesota area. He is buried along side of his wife, Agnes in the Walhalla catholic cemetery on top of the hill overlooking Walhalla. Father Longpre was the parish priest at the time and said the burial mass 
2 CONC at St Boniface in Walhalla.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Antoine inherited one-eigth Salteaux (Objibwa) from his father's side(his great grandmother Marie Salteaux Lambert) was full blooded Salteaux. He also inherited one-eigth indian blood (most likely cree) from his mother, Theresa 
2 CONC Laliberte, making Antoine one-fourth indian.  Thus, Antoine like to drink and party, and after making his veternarian rounds would end up drinking for 2 or 3 days in later years mostly after his family was grown. He owned cars 
2 CONC such as the ford Model T, Model A and later in 1933 bought a new 33 chevy (the style where the doors opened from the front, however he never drove the cars himself. He had a hired assistant that helped him and drove him on the 
2 CONC rounds for his veternarian work. Of course, it was always followed up by a good party in the bars in Langdon, Walhalla, Osnabrook, or the nearest little town.

1 NOTE Born to a french father and Metisse woman who was one-half Salteaux Indian giving Antoine 1/4 indian
2 CONT 
2 CONT Antoine(Sr) Lariviere was born in 1847 in the parish of St. Francis-Xavier in what is now the west side of Winnipeg, Man. Canada to Louis Lariviere and Marie Lambert. Louis Lariviere was a french(no known indian blood) voyageur 
2 CONC for the Hudson's Bay company from Jesus Island in Montreal, Canada. Marie was part indian ( one-half) and French. Antoine married Therese LaLiberte on Jan 10, 1871 at St Francis-Xavier parish. She was "not of age" according to the 
2 CONC records at St Francis church. She was born in 1853, but must not have had her 18th birthday yet. The marriage ceremony was performed by Father F.X. Kavanagh and witnessed by Louis Lariviere and Francois Morin. "All were from the 
2 CONC parish".
2 CONT The mission at Baie St. Paul was serviced by St Francis-Xavier until 1873. The mission became an establised parish on its own in 1874 and was later named St. Eustache. The church was then located on the north side of the 
2 CONC Assiniboine River. In 1881 the river flooded and destroyed the church. The priest, Father St. Pierre, left with many members of his church and moved to south into what is now North Dakota at Olga. The Larivere families also moved 
2 CONC including Louis and sons Antoine and Francois and their families. Louis's wife died in 1900, so he came and lived with Antoine Sr. until he died in 1910 or 1912 in Olga. The St Eustache parish was rebuilt on the south of the 
2 CONC Assiniboine in 1882. Francois Lariviere (Brother of Antoine) came back to St Eustache a few years later and used Desriviere version of our name. It means the same as Lariviere, "The River".
2 CONT The first two children of Antoine and Therese, Elise and Melanie, were born and baptized in St. Francis Xavier parish. The next five children were born in the parish of St Eustache; Antoine, Alex, Marie, Apoline and Sara. Melanie 
2 CONC died at the age of 7 on Jan 10, 1881(must be buried in the St. Eustache cemetery).
2 CONT Antoine Sr. was trained in a vetenarian trade school (according to my grandmother) in Montreal for about two years. He practised this trade in the Olga area from 1882 until his death in 1910. The trade was quite properous since 
2 CONC every farmer used horses for plowing, haying, harvesting and transportation. Cattle also required veternarian attention also. Maybe that is why he was able to afford so many children--19.
2 CONT Antoine Sr was a good friend of Hyacinthe Villeneuve. They did have a family connection. Antoine's wife was the daughter of Marie Robillard and Alex LaLiberte. Hyacinthe's brother, Francois Villeneuve, was married to Marie's 
2 CONC sister Justine Robillard.
2 CONT The following incidents personally told to me by Alex Lariviere, the second oldest son of Antoine Sr. on July 18, 1970 when I visited him at his home in GlassGlow, Montana. My wife, Peggy and my four kids were with me at the time.
2 CONT He lived at 841 3rd ave in Glassglow then.
2 CONT "My father(Antoine Sr) died from an accident that occurred while drinking in an extended New Years celebration. It was customary then to celebrate the New Year for a whole week with neighbors and friends by eating, drinking and 
2 CONC visiting. The new year of 1910 was being celebrated at Antoines by some of the older men including Hyacinthe Villeneuve. On january 2nd or the 3rd, the men started drinking again after having celebrated all day Jan 1 and of course 
2 CONC New Years eve. The men had started dancing together and singing. Antoine's wife had went the cellar to get more food to do some cooking and left the cellar door open. The men hadn't noticed and kept dancing. Antoine Sr. fell in 
2 CONC and apparently broke his leg. The men, being too old and a little tipsy, couldn't get him out. They went and got help from sons Antoine and Alex and few neighbors. They got him out and put him on the bed and tried to get fix his 
2 CONC leg but the leg swelled up to a tremendous size because of internal bleeding. Apparently the broken bone had pierced an artery and caused internal bleeding. The doctor, if there was one, or anyone else  wasn't able to do anything 
2 CONC to stop the bleeding, only to apply tourniquets. His condition worsened as blood poisoning began to set in and the loss of blood continued. After about a week, he died. Before that he had been in good health. At the end he turned 
2 CONC almost green, probably from blood poisoning. " On the day my father died, my brother, Antoine, came over to my house and said "if you want to see your father before he dies, you better come now". My brother was very matter of fact 
2 CONC about it".
2 CONT "My father and Antoine Jr. liked to drink, especially in later years. I use to accompany him on his rounds to the farms for his work. I took care of the teams of horses when on these trips. I would harness, unharness, feed them 
2 CONC and get them ready when we left for the next farm.  After finishing the work at the farm, the farmer would offer drinks and food and, if the work lasted more than one day, which it usually did, he would provide a place to sleep. 
2 CONC On many occassions when we were ready to leave, they would send me to harness the horses as they started to drink. I didn't drink, so I was assigned this duty. My brother, Antoine did drink, so he would drink with my father. After 
2 CONC drinking for a while they would tell me to unharness the horses and they would party throughout the nite. Sometimes this would go on for as long as a week. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and didn't  go with them anymore". As 
2 CONC Alex told this about his past times with his father he had tears in his eyes.
2 CONT Antoine was a tall man, "over 6'5", very tall for those days. Several of his brothers were also tall. His younger Paul was also about 6'5".
2 CONT 
2 CONT In the N. Dak census of 1900, the kids from Zephrin on down were at home. The census was recorded in the Walhalla township census and not in the of Olga or Beaulieu townships, I assume that the Walhalla township is next to 
2 CONC Beaulieau township. The census lists David Lariviere as born in 1889, Joe in 1894, John in 1895 and Clara in 1896.
2 CONT Many of the family members left after Antoine and later Louis died (1911) and went to SASK to homestead. Antoine and his brother Frank, Edward, and Joe stayed around Olga for several years. Antoine Sr's brother Paul also stayed 
2 CONC around Olga. Later probably about 1916-17 Frank and Ed went to work in the Iron Mines in Hibbing Minn. where they lived and raised their families there.

1 NOTE Theresa LaLiberte was the daughter of Alex LaLiberte and Marie Robillard. Marie Robillard's mother was Antoinette Lajomodere, who, in turn was the half sister to Louis Riel's mother. Through this line, the descendants of Antoine 
2 CONC and Theresa are related to Louis Riel.  (Antoinette's mother was a full blooded indian woman from the Pembina area, probably Assiniboine or Salteaux or Cree)
2 CONT Theresa married Antoine Lariviere Sr. at  St Francis- Xavier parish in Winnipeg Canada when she was 17 years old. At present, there no information on the heritage of Alex LaLiberte except that he was probably french and indian. 
2 CONC Her mother, Marie Robillard was at least one quarter indian, Cree. This assumes that Marie's father, Jean Baptiste Robillard, was a full blooded frenchman.
2 CONT Her Father was also one-quarter indian, making Theresa one-quarter indian.
2 CONT Theresa and Antoine had 19 children and all except one who died at a young age, lived into their later years, with most of them living to the late 80's and some into their 90's.
2 CONT The children who died were Melanie age 7 years; Sarah age 3; Hector age 1; Josephine age 15; John age 17; Victor age 10 mos; and one other who must of died at birth.
2 CONT 
2 CONT After Antoine died, Theresa married Frank Langevin sometime before June 1911. According to an application for homestead near where Zehprin live dated June 1911, she was listed as Mrs Langevin. Theresa must of moved to Naicam 
2 CONC Saskachewan, either in April/May of 1911 or during the fall of 1910.  The homestead was proved in 1915. She died in Naicam on July 11th, 1927 at the age of 71.
2 CONT Theresa is buried in Beauchamp, SK. is Antoine's wife.  I got the infor from a Garth Ulrich who is some kind of Historian in that area.  He actually has gone to the cemetery there.
2 CONT She was accompanied to Naicum by her unmarried daughter Hilda and her married daughter Elise and her family (Mrs Adolph Langevin, son of Frank Langevin)
2 CONT Her other daughte, Mary, Mrs Louis Dease, had preceded her by arriving in Naicum in 1910 by train at Watson, Sask.
2 CONT Many of the residents of Olga area, especially the Larivieres and the Villeneuves, actually lived in the area called Beaulieu which is north & east along the county road down the hills and around  a curve about 6 or7 miles from 
2 CONC Olga. However, Alex Lariviere, told me that when His father was alive, they lived in the town proper of Olga.
2 CONT Theresa had seven brothers, Joseph, Jean Baptiste, Joachim, R?, Lazare, Etienne and Modeste and two sisters, Angelique and Arsensoe. Etienne and Modeste never married and were bachelors. Angelique married Charles Lussier and 
2 CONC Arsenoe married Napoleon Normand.
2 CONT Angelique and her family stayed in Canada(St Eustache) and they are still there(1995). I received pictures from a daughter of Angelique, named Camelia Lussier Allary, in 1964 through the St Eustache parish priest, father Paquet
2 CONT 
2 CONT Zephrin applied for homestead near Naicum, Sask in 1905.
2 CONT His brother David applied for a homestead in Naicum area in 1907.
2 CONT Joe applied for a homestead in the same area in 1912 and proved it
2 CONT (satisfied the homestead requirements by living and farming it for
2 CONT 4 years)  in 1916. Which means he didn't go to the Hibbing area until
2 CONT after that.
2 CONT Theresa Lariviere applied for a homestead in June 1911 in the same
2 CONT area. She was then Mrs Frank Langevin, but applied under the right
2 CONT of Antoine Lariviere, which is kind of strange.
2 CONT Her daughter, Mary (Mrs Louis Dease by then) arrived in Naicum
2 CONT in October of 1910 by train.

4 TEXT SNOQUALMIE VALLEY - There's no way of knowing how cancer will play a role in one's life, but those who are touched by the disease know it will change the way they live the rest of their days.
5 CONT 
5 CONT The book's cover was illustrated by Mount Si High School student Jessica Blessard (left) who had her own experience with cancer while working on the book.
5 CONT 
5 CONT Gaynel Gunderson's experience with cancer involved losing her brother, Neil Rogers. Jessica Blessard's meant losing an ovary. Still, something good came from both their pain.
5 CONT The women met when Gunderson wrote a book to help others deal with cancer. "Love, Hope, Faith: A Personal Journey Through Cancer" has just been published by Gunderson, a lifelong Valley resident and daughter of Ken and Medora 
5 CONC Rogers, who founded Ken's Cafe in 1941 and Truck Town in the 1960s
5 CONT "Love, Hope, Faith" is the story of how Gunderson coped with the experience of her brother Neil's journey through pancreatic cancer. Neil was a prominent Valley businessman for decades and received the Small Business Association's 
5 CONC Entrepreneurial Success Award for Truck Town in 1992.
5 CONT As a child, Gunderson felt a special bond with Neil, who was much closer to her in age than her other two brothers. Laced throughout the memoir are excerpts from a journal Gunderson kept during Neil's struggle with cancer.
5 CONT "It has to do with my love for my brother, my hope he'd be healed and how our faith got us through it," Gunderson said. "I think I did it mostly to help myself heal because it was so very hard to go through and after my husband 
5 CONC and daughter read it, they thought it would really help other people."
5 CONT Rogers was planning to retire in 2001 and he and his wife Mary were in the midst of planning to go on a cruise when Rogers began feeling poorly. He went to the doctor to make sure he was healthy enough for the cruise and that's 
5 CONC when the cancer was found.
5 CONT "They never did get to take the trip," Gunderson said.
5 CONT The family didn't know anything about pancreatic cancer - including the fact that it is terminal - until it became a part of their lives.
5 CONT Gunderson wrote her 75-page book in increments. "I could only do a little at a time because it was so hard," she said.
5 CONT She saved it on her computer and on a floppy disk and walked away from it for six months. When she returned, it seemed both copies had been erased. "So, I wrote it again and it was better the second time, and it helped me heal 
5 CONC more," Gunderson said.
5 CONT Gunderson finished the second version last fall and found Mount Si High School sophomore Jessica Blessard willing to produce the cover art. Gunderson's husband, Jed, suggested a book cover showing that people can rise above the 
5 CONC dark cloud of cancer, and Blessard captured that in the photo for the cover in her digital imaging class at school by using PhotoShop to smudge and filter the scene just right.
5 CONT But when Blessard began working on the image, she didn't realize she was about to have a brush with cancer herself. Severe stomach pain led to a doctor visit that revealed a 10-pound cyst on her left ovary. The growth was benign 
5 CONC but doctors said it was just starting to become a tumor.
5 CONT "It made me think it was really kind of interesting that it happened when it did - like I was supposed to do the book cover. It was kind of inspirational; kind of like I knew what [Gunderson] was feeling," Blessard said.
5 CONT Both Blessard and Gunderson believe that when bad things happen, people can learn from them and help others.
5 CONT "I prayed constantly for a miracle because miracles do happen," Gunderson said. "I counted on that, but it doesn't always happen. I think people need to understand that and that cancer isn't God's fault. Some people blame him 
5 CONC because he allows bad things to happen, but through this whole thing we relied totally on God. He gave us what we needed to get through it and he answered our prayers in other ways. We got all our strength from him."
5 CONT In the end, Gunderson said, she realized their prayers were answered in so many ways and Neil was eventually healed by reaching "the ultimate goal" of heaven in February of 2001. He was 55.
5 CONT Gunderson, who now lives in Soap Lake, hopes her book will help others deal with their own journey through cancer. Blessard thinks that maybe God wants people to learn to deal with struggles like cancer so they can help other 
5 CONC people.
5 CONT Neil is survived by his wife Mary of North Bend; four children; and many grandchildren.
5 CONT "Love, Hope, Faith: A Personal Journey Through Cancer" is available for $10.95 at www.barnesandnoble.com, www.amazon.com and at Ken's Gas & Grocery at Exit 34 off Interstate-90.
